cGromCorr README
============

Package contains:
    /src, containing cGromCorr executable. This takes an FMO trajectory (.gro) and computes the CDC interactions (Renger & Madjet 2006) to get the dynamics and decomposition of the energy gap in time.
    /scrits/pyPCA, a package of executables to process the output from cGromCorr and perform analysis on the results. As of 4/14, this includes PCA, mode timeseries, histograms, and spatial visualization of modes via Chimera.

Requirements:
    * boost_filesystem (tested on v1.55)
    * boost_system (tested on v1.55)
Optional (but will probably need to be modified without it):
    * Chombo Timer (CH_timer, version uncertain)


Uses:
    * A reduced "forcefield" of charges and masses, to be stored in a dictionary indexed by (molName,atomNames). 
        Data is loaded from a .top file with .itp includes.
    * Data from .gro file to locate atomNames (required to have chromophores called BCL), loaded frame-by-frame.
    * A .itp file specifying the chromophore "CDC" ground/excited state charges (required to be called BCX).

1. Make using src/basic_test.sh for basic compilation check
2. Use FMO topology file (BCL atomname required)
3. Select a number of frames to read that is <= number of frames in the file. WARNING: WILL SEG FAULT IF CONDITION IT NOT MET.
3. Make and run using src/basic_run.sh
